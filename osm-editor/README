OpenStreetMap Editor
====================

Notes:
- Requires Qt3 and the modified Jeeps library to compile. Jeeps can be 
found in the jeeps-0.1.4-nick subdirectory.
- There are three real GPX files to play with. Look at the lats and longs
therein and start osmeditor with the appropriate options.
- No instructions as yet, only the source...

Definite problems at time of initial commit to Subversion:

- will only run in the source directory as it requires a subdirectory "images" 
containing the icons.
- GPX timestamps are numeric rather than the standard XML timestamp format. SORTED.
- probably some others :-)
- crashes after GPS read. SORTED. 

To build on Debian/sarge, one need to install the following dependencies:

  libqt3-mt-dev libwww-ssl-dev libxmlrpc-c3-dev libcurl3-dev
