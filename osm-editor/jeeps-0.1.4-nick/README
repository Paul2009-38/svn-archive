General Compilation
-------------------


GCC and CC compilers
--------------------

The 'configure' script looks for a working GNU C compiler (gcc) and uses it
by default if it is found. You can force 'configure' to use the
standard C compiler (cc) by either adding a line to the 'configure'
script:

CC=cc

or by defining a shell variable:

set CC="cc"

The file 'config.cache' seems to retain the value for this option. If you
have already run 'configure' you may need to delete the 'config.cache' file
when changing back to the gcc compiler.


Shared libraries
----------------

By default, the configure script builds shared libraries using
libtool. Whilst this is very nice for making usable binaries, it can be
a pain when trying to debug a program. For that reason, compilation of
shared libraries can be turned off by specifying the
'--disable-shared' option to 'configure'.

Compilation Problems
--------------------

On some systems there may be compatibility problems with different
automake, autoconf or libtool versions. Always make sure that you keep
up to date with releases of these tools and let me know of any problems
you experience. If a libtool problem does arise you can try deleting
   config.cache
   ltmain.sh
   ltconfig
   libtool
and then type
   aclocal
   autoconf
   automake -a
and then retry the make.
