osm2shp transforms OSM data to shapefiles; at the moment, one shapefile for
nodes with tags, and another for ways (assumed to be polylines) is generated.

osm2shp is licenced under the GPL version 2.

osm2shp requires libosm (available in Subversion - the paths in the Makefile
should be correct), shapelib and expat. The paths for the latter two need
manually setting up.

shapelib is available from http://shapelib.maptools.org.
expat is available from http://expat.sourceforge.net.
