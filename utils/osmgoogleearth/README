Transform OpenStreetMap .osm file into KML file for Google Earth. 

You need a file called data.osm. When you call make a file map.kmz will
be generated. This file contains a Google Earth KML file and some icons.

Load it into Google Earth with the menu "Add" -> "Network Link...". It
will appear in the Places list. Double click it there to fly to the
place.

Currently only some streets, parks, and parking lots are shown, but it
is easy to improve on this.

The isle_of_wight.kmz file is provided as an example.
