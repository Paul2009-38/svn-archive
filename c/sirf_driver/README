SiRF chipset driver
===================

Copyleft 2004, Matt Amos

You should just type "make" and see if it works!

There are no external dependances, other than STL and a C++
compiler. This won't work on a non-UNIX platform, as it depends on
fairly low-level terminal commands.

By default, it will produce a "sirfdump" executable, but have a play
around with the 'src/main.cpp' file. Most of the output packet types
are there, but the input packets are not finished yet.
