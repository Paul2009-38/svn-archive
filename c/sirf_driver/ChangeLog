======================
added writing ability by splitting Stream into Input- and OutputStream
classes. this means i can do more interesting stuff, like asking for
versions of the firmware. this is good because it gives a warning at
the beginning if the version response is never received.

======================
finished off that writing support - now it actually works!
the demo program now queries the firmware version before
proceding. now i have to add in some bits to support going to extended
mode at 57600 baud and we should have pseudo range...
... then i need to bolt some gpx writer to the end, make a gui, win
the lottery, etc...

======================
fixed some makefile issues, an end-of-string bug. added better
printing for SoftwareVersion packets and a VisibleList packet. added
support for dumping unknown packets to disk in binary for later
analysis and guessing what they are!
