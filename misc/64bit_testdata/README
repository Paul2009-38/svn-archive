Test data for 64bit node IDs

This directory contains three sets of files which you can use to
test-run the OSM software you are using and see if it supports IDs
larger than the signed 32bit integer range (2^31-1).

It is expected that OSM node IDs will break this barrier in early 
2013.

The test data is a small sample from OSM data and depicts the area 
around V. C. Bird International Airport on the Caribbean island of 
Antigua, and covers the following bounding box:

minlon=-61.8114 minlat=17.1255 maxlon=-61.7733 maxlat=17.1542


The files are:

base-X.osm 
base-X.osm.pbf
   - basic OSM data for the sample area.

diff-X.osc
   - a diff that adds the Stanford Cricket Ground to the data.

full-X.osm
full-X.osm.pbf
   - sample area including the Stanford Cricket Ground.

There are three sets of files with different "X":

X = s32
   - signed 32bit id range; these files should work correctly
   with all existing software. Contains some nodes in the 1...1000
   range and some in the 2**31-2500 range.

X = u32
   - unsigned 32bit id range; if your software works with these
   then you're probably good for another year. Contains some nodes
   in the 1...1000 range and some in the 2**31...2**31+1000 range
   so that they would wrap to 1...1000 if you were limited to 2**31.

X = 64
   - 64bit id range; if your software works with these then you
   you're ok for quite a long time to come. Contains some nodes
   in the 1...1000 range and some in the 2**32...2**32+1000 range
   so that they would wrap to 1...1000 if you were limited to 2**32.

There is also a file called broken.osm which depicts what happens
if you do indeed have an integer overflow; it contains lots of nodes
twice. There's also a "correct.png" showing how the data looks like
in JOSM, and "broken.png" which is something you'll see if you have
an integer overflow.
