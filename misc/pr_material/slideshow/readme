This is a slodeshow with iamges related to OpenStreetMap.
The images are mostly "Images of the Week" from the OpenStreetMap Wiki, others were given to and chosen by Frederik Ramm as he asked for some to show as a slideshow at the Intergeo.

Some images were added later by user malenki.

How this works:
"list" contains the list of files which will be shown plus a description for each of them.

Based on this list make.pl creates in the directory "out" images with all the same size, containing the source image with a black frame and the description as caption beside them. 

In its header make.pl has settings for the size and placement of the captions and the output size of the images.

After generating the images, display the files in the directory "out" with an imageviewer like geeqie (successor of gqview) or a similar program capable of doing a slideshow.
