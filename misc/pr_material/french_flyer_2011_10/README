This directory contains files for an OSM flyer (in French, from the 
original German version) that was created by Frederik Ramm 
<frederik@remote.org> and contributors from the talk-de list in 
January 2008, and subsequently updated over the years. 
The latest version was mainly made by Soeren Gasch 
<soeren@geofabrik.de>, then translated by Frédéric Rodrigo and
Vincent Privat.

All contents are in the public domain except those derived from OSM 
which are CC-BY-SA.

The flyer is designed for DIN A7 as the final size (105mm high and
74mm wide), with 8 pages in a zig-zag ("Leporello") fold, and full
colour printing.

The flyers have been made with Inkscape:
Light version: osmflyer1.svg and osmflyer2.svg are the front and 
reverse side. 
Complete version: osmdepliant1.svg and osmdepliant2.svg are the front 
and reverse side. 

See German README file for further information.
