This utility expands abbreviations in imported TIGER data using the list
of Spanish and English abbreviations from TIGER dataset's documentation.
English is the default, the first and only parameter can be appended to
select the language ("./expand.py es" switches to Spanish).  The script
takes an osm file on standard input and outputs an osmChange file to
expand abbreviations in "name" and "name_N" tag values found.  If new
TIGER imports ever happen this should definitely be done *before*
importing new data to avoid spamming the ways' history, so it needs to
be modified to run as part of the conversion.

Abbreviations are bad, mkay.

The resulting osc also removes the "upload_uuid" tag on all ways it touches.
