Code in this directory is originally from Jakob Altenstein's Bachelor 
Thesis in which he developed a tool to 

* visualize the impact of the license change on a current map
* simulate the license change, resulting in a (possibly) diminished map

The tool is written in Java.

The tool supports various modes of operation and some aspects are configurable,
e.g. you can tell the tool to ignore all changes in a "created by" tag or
to treat a position change of less than 1 metre as trivial or so, and see how
your changes affect the outcome.

The tools needs an excerpt from the OSM full history file to work, as well
as the current list of people having agreed to ODbL.

This currently committed version lacks a build script and JAR file so you
have to build it with javac:

cd src; javac de/altenstein/osm/OdblSimulator.java 

and run it like so:

java -cp src de.altenstein.osm.OdblSimulator

Also, the file names are hard-coded in the main file. 

FEEL FREE TO MODIFY THE CODE.
