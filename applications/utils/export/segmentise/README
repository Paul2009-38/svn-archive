This is a simple command-line application to break OSM ways into segments
at joins with other ways. It has been designed with the requirements of
Freemap (free-map.org.uk) in mind; consequently it is aimed at segmentising
low-density OSM highway data such as rural footpaths. It might not be
suitable for other use cases. 

It is licenced under the GNU GPL version 2.

Usage: segmentise OSMfile. Writes to standard output.

Requirements: expat 2 is required for the XML parsing. On Debian/Ubuntu
systems, you should simply be able to apt-get the dev package.
