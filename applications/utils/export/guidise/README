guidise: A tool to assign a globally unique 64-bit ID to nodes and ways.

Why? Sites which make use of OSM data, such as Freemap, might wish to
add extra information to specific OSM features. This could include,
for example, pub reviews or annotations along ways, e.g. directions 
along a footpath. Problem is that every time the local database is
reloaded with OSM data, there is the risk that the OSM ID might change.

guidise is an effort to prevent this: by assigning a geographically
based globally unique (hopefully) identifier to each way, the hope is
that this identifier will be preserved.

For nodes the GUID is composed of a combination of its position on
earth in tens of metres (16 bits for easting, 17 for northing), and the 
feature type (8 bits). Currently only cities, towns, villages, 
hamlets, pubs, peaks and restaurants are given GUIDs.

For ways, the GUID is composed of a combination of the position of
its westernmost point (16 bits for easting, 17 for northing again;
4 bits for bearing from westernmost to easternmost point (a 16-point
scale, 0=E, 1=ENE, 2=NE, 3=NNE etc) and 8 bits for the length of the
way in tenths of kilometres.

Note that the number of bits have been chosen so that it will
(hopefully) give unique IDs in the UK. More bits would obviously be
needed for it to work globally.

The chances of globally unique IDs should be significantly enhanced if this
tool is used in conjunction with the segmentise tool (breaks OSM ways into
"segments", really just smaller ways, at junctions, also available from SVN
under the "utils/export" directory).

It is licenced under the GNU GPL version 2, and uses ccoord, a C++
library for converting OSGB<->latlong, itself based on Jonathan Stott's
JCoord library (www.jstott.me.uk/jcoord).

Usage: guidise OSMfile. Writes to standard output.

Requirements: expat 2 is required for the XML parsing. On Debian/Ubuntu
systems, you should simply be able to apt-get the dev package.
