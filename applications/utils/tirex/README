Tirex Tile Rendering System
===========================

Tirex is a bunch of tools that let you run a tile server. A tile server
is a web server that hands out pre-rendered map raster images to clients.

Further documentation is in the doc/ subdirectory.

The web page for Tirex is at http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tirex .

PERL MODULES
------------

You'll need the following Perl modules:

* IPC::ShareLite (Debian/Ubuntu: libipc-sharelite-perl)
* JSON           (Debian/Ubuntu: libjson-perl)
* GD             (Debian/Ubuntu: libgd-gd2-perl)
* LWP            (Debian/Ubuntu: libwww-perl)


LOGGING
-------

Tirex-master has two logs:
* General noticies, warnings, errors, debug messages and the like are
  logged via syslog. You can configure the syslog facility that should
  be used ('master_syslog_facility').
* For each rendered metatile a line is written to a logfile. This can
  be used for generating statistics. Failed renderings (when the
  rendering backend didn't answer) are not logged here (but in the syslog).
  Use the config variable 'master_logfile' to set the filename for this
  log.


TESTING
-------

Call 'prove' in the main directory to run Perl tests. You need Test::More
(Debian/Ubuntu: libtest-simple-perl) and Test::Harness (Debian/Ubuntu:
libtest-harness-perl) installed.

Call 'perl test/queue_speed_test.pl' to run queue speed test.
