Tirex Features
--------------

* Flexible system mostly implemented in Perl

* The part that does the rendering (tirex-renderd) is decoupled from the rest of the system. This makes upgrades of the independent parts easier and allows you to swap in a different renderer config or even a completely different renderer easily


* No multi-threading which is notoriously difficult to debug
* Multi-processing so that it can use all the CPUs your machine has
* Lots of config options to encourage experimentation

* Extensive documentation for the system, each binary and the Perl libraries
* Lots of unit tests for the Perl library to give you some confidence that it actually works
* Easy to install because there are several Debian/Ubuntu packages for all parts of the system
