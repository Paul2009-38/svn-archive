The following things might be interesting improvements to Tiles@Home for Windows:

1) Use more advanced download plugin as a replacement for the used ones:
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in

2) create a modern GUI for the rendering process. It could be running as a screensaver displaying tiles as they are rendered

3) make it compatible with Vista. Users with reduced rights, update of the program

4) enable different location than c:\tilesathome. requires adapting the classpath inside tilesathome

5) provide unistaller with menu to aks user whether to uninstall fonts

6) sign uninstaller [I have a cacert.org certificate for code-signing (stephankn)]

7) provide different languages in installer and GUI
