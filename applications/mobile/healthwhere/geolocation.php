On supported browsers, Healthwhere uses <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation">geolocation</a> technology to automatically populate the latitude &amp; longitude boxes with your location. Note that accuracy varies greatly, so you may wish to enter a postcode or latitude &amp; longitude manually, if you know them.

<p>
Your position is determined by your browser, and methods vary. If you are using a device that has a GPS receiver, this will probably be used to determine your position, with a good level of accuracy. See your browser's documentation for more information.
