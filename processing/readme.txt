You'll need Processing 0090 or higher.  www.processing.org

This uses a few bits of openmap and the Apache XML-RPC and Commons Codecs libraries 

(not sure if the full source for these is in the OSM tree yet, will take a look)

Copy the "utm" folder into your Processing sketchbook, put your own username and password in and hit run.

Plenty of TODO items, but I thought this might be interesting for folks to play with.
