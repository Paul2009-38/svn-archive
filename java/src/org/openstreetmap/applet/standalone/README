These are files I have created with the aim of producing a standalone
version of the OpenStreetMap applet which can also handle loading and saving
GPX. The java files from the openstreetmap applet package are all here but
all have been depackaged for the moment.  You will need the openstreetmap and
openmap JAR files to compile.
