If you are using Internet Explorer then you may experience some glitches with images and placement of bits of text. Sorry, IE doesn't conform to a lot of web standards that it should do. These things will be fixed but they're low priority. Please consider using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> (its free!) or any other good browser.
