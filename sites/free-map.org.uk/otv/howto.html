<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>This page details how to contribute photos or panoramas to 
OpenTrailView. </p>
<h3>Sign up</h3>
<p>You need to be logged in to submit a photo. So

<h3>What type of photos should be contributed?</h3>
<p>One of OpenTrailView's aims is to produce a "Google StreetView" like
experience for paths and trails, by creating a linked database of 360
degree panoramas. However, creating a panorama can take some patience, so
for that reason, you can now contribute regular georeferenced
photos too. (However, note that these currently will not show properly
in the viewing interface). 
The sections below deal with contributing regular photos, 
and 360 degree panoramas.</p>
<h3>Taking photos or panoramas</h3>
<h4>Regular photos</h4>
<ul>
<li>While out for a walk or hike, simply take a series of photos along
the path or trail you're following, ideally aligned with the path or trail
so that they can be orientated easily later on.</li>
<li>Ideally, every time you take a photo in the direction you're
travelling, also take a photo in the <em>opposite</em> direction, so that
someone travelling in the opposite direction can see a sequence of
photos in the correct order.</li>
<li>At certain places, e.g. crossroads, you might also want to take 4
photos at 90 degrees to each other. The upload interface (see below) can
handle individual photos, photo pairs at 180 degrees to each other,
and sets of four at 90 degrees to each other.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Taking 360 degree panoramas</h4>
<ul>
<li>
It's important to make the centre of the panorama face your direction
of travel; this is needed to align the panorama with the path you're
following, using an OSM map, later on. At the very least, you need to know
which direction the centre of the panorama is facing!</li>
<li>To do this when out, turn in the opposite direction to the direction
you're travelling and slightly to the right. Take a series of photos, turning
clockwise, until finally you take a photo which faces in the opposite 
direction to the direction you're travelling and slightly to the left, at
the same angle (but left, rather than right) as your original photo.
Ensure each successive photo overlaps with the previous as the photo stitching
software works by identifying common features.</li>
<li> To actually create a panorama, do the following:
use photo stitching
software, such as the free and open source
<a href='http://hugin.sourceforge.net'>Hugin</a> (commercial photostitchers are
available too) to stitch the photos to make a panorama. Note that Hugin
might comment that your panorama stitching is a "very bad fit". This may or
may not be the case, so check your panorama for uneven overlaps (sometimes
its automatically-picked control points aren't the best) and re-specify
the control points if necessary. Sometimes, however, Hugin appears to
consider it a "very bad fit" when no noticeable irregularities in stitching
are present!</li>
<li>Try to scale your panorama to be 400 pixels in height, using image
manipulation software - e.g. GIMP, ImageMagick, or similar. The OTV website
will scale your panorama to a height of 400 pixels - and, if the panorama
is not this height already, it might appear pixellated and indistinct. 
Example of doing this in ImageMagick:
<pre>
convert -resize x400 in.jpg out.jpg
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Georeferencing photos and panoramas</h3>
<ul>
<li>The most automatic way of georeferencing your photos is to 
record a GPS track of your trip and save it as a GPX file.
A GPS track with timestamps can now be used in conjunction with timestamped 
photos to work out where the photos was taken as part of the photo upload
process. 
You can avoid this procedure taking too long and overloading the server
by creating a GPX file with
minimal trackpoints; adjust the settings on your
GPS device to record trackpoints as infrequently as possible. As an 
alternative, you can estimate the position by
clicking on the map on the submission page, or, if you are using a camera with
GPS (e.g. smartphone), the EXIF latitude and longitude tags will be 
automatically read.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Uploading</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submit photos and panoramas by following the link on the form on the main 
page. 
Upload your photos one by one; you can use the map to estimate the latitude
and longitude or use a GPS track (see above).
</li>
<li>
For single photos and panoramas, click "New
photo set" once it's uploaded.However, if
you are uploading pairs or sets of four, you need to make sure that each
photo in the pair or set is linked. To do this, click "Add another photo to
set", upload the next in the set and specify the orientation of the next
photo <em>with respect to the first photo in the set</em>. The orientation
currently must be 180 degrees, 90 degrees clockwise, or 90 degrees
anticlockwise. </li>
<li>Once you've uploaded all the photos or panoramas
from a trip, you can optionally 
upload a GPX track; this will automatically calculate the position of each
photo or panorama if both the track and the panoramas have timestamps.</li>
<li>Wait for your photos or panoramas to be authorised.</li>
<li>On the map on the main page, click the "Align photos" button below the
map, and align an authorised
photo or panorama by rotating the camera icons. The camera should face
the same direction as either:
	<ul>
	<li>the centre of a single photo;</li>
	<li>the centre of a panorama;</li>
	<li>or the centre of the <em>first photo in a set</em> for photo pairs
	or sets of four.</li>
	</ul>
Align it with the footpath or trail that you took
it from, by rotating the camera icon on the map so that it faces the same
direction as the centre of the photo. To get back to the normal mode,
where moving over a camera icon shows a photo, click the "View photos"
button.</li>
</ul>
