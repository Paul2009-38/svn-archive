<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>This page details how to contribute panoramas to 
OpenTrailView. </p>
<h3>Important note!</h3>
<p>Many features of OTV do not currently work in Internet Explorer. Sorry
about that, but for the moment I would recommend you use an up-to-date
version of Firefox or Chrome instead. It is an eventual aim to fully support
IE, but this will only take place when all aspects of OTV are fully
functional on other browsers.</p>
<h3>Sign up</h3>
<p>You need to be logged in to submit a panorama. So 
<a href='/common/user.php?action=signup'>sign up</a> now!</p>
<h3>What type of photos should be contributed?</h3>
<p>One of OpenTrailView's aims is to produce a "Google StreetView" like
experience for paths and trails, by creating a linked database of 360
degree panoramas. </p>
<h3>Taking panoramas</h3>
<ul>
<li>
It's important to make the centre of the panorama face your direction
of travel; this is needed to align the panorama with the path you're
following, using an OSM map, later on. At the very least, you need to know
which direction the centre of the panorama is facing!</li>
<li>To do this when out, turn in the opposite direction to the direction
you're travelling and slightly to the right. Take a series of photos, turning
clockwise, until finally you take a photo which faces in the opposite 
direction to the direction you're travelling and slightly to the left, at
the same angle (but left, rather than right) as your original photo.
Ensure each successive photo overlaps with the previous as the photo stitching
software works by identifying common features.</li>
<li> To actually create a panorama, do the following:
	<ul>
	<li>resize your photos to around 800x600. This significantly increases
	the chance of the stitcher (well, Hugin at least) stitching the photos
	successfully.
	Example of doing this in ImageMagick:
<pre>
convert -resize 800x600 in.jpg out.jpg
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>use photo stitching
	software, such as the free and open source
	<a href='http://hugin.sourceforge.net'>Hugin</a> 
	(commercial photostitchers are
	available too) to stitch the photos to make a panorama. Note that Hugin
might occasionally
comment that your panorama stitching is a bad fit. This may or
may not be the case, so check your panorama for uneven overlaps (sometimes
its automatically-picked control points aren't the best) and re-specify
the control points if necessary. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Uploading and managing panoramas</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submit panoramas by following the link on the form on the main 
page. 
You can now upload a whole batch of photos at once; thanks to Andrew Valums
for his JavaScript photo uploader.</li>
<li>Once you've uploaded all the photos or panoramas
from a trip, you can optionally 
upload a GPS track in GPX format; 
this will automatically calculate the position of each
panorama if both the track and the panoramas have timestamps.</li>
<li>You can then visit the photo manager page to position any unpositioned
photos (using an OSM slippy map) or group together photos taken in different
directions from the same place.</li>
<li>The next stage is to orientate your panoramas. On the map on the main page, 
click the "Rotate" button below the map, and align a
photo or panorama by rotating the camera icons. The camera should face
the same direction as the centre of the panorama.
Align it with the footpath or trail that you took
it from, by rotating the camera icon on the map so that it faces the same
direction as the centre of the panorama. To get back to the normal mode,
where moving over a camera icon shows a panorama, click the "View"
button.</li>
<li>You can drag photos round the map to change their position (if logged in)
via the "Move" option. (currently disabled)</li>
<li>Wait for your panoramas to be authorised. You will be able
to see them in the meantime, but other people will not. Authorisation should
normally take place within a day (unless I'm on holiday!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Making routes</h3>
<p>The key feature of OTV is that <strong>photos can be
linked together in a route</strong>, which users will soon be able to 
virtually "walk" down, a la StreetView. 
This will work by linking the panorama to the underlying OpenStreetMap
way; when a panorama is added, the nearest OSM way will be located
(in a local copy of the OSM database) and the panorama "attached" to it.
