<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>This page details how to contribute a panorama to 
OpenTrailView. Note that this procedure is likely to be refined as soon as
it's worked out what the optimal dimensions of a panorama are, etc.</p>
<h3>Sign up</h3>
<p>You need to be logged in to submit a photo. So 
<a href='signup.php'>sign up</a> now!</p>
<h3>Taking the panorama</h3>
<ul>
<li>
It's important to make the centre of the panorama face your direction
of travel; this is needed to align the panorama with the path you're
following, using an OSM map, later on.</li>
<li>To do this when out, turn in the opposite direction to the direction
you're travelling and slightly to the right. Take a series of photos, turning
clockwise, until finally you take a photo which faces in the opposite 
direction to the direction you're travelling and slightly to the left, at
the same angle (but left, rather than right) as your original photo.
Ensure each successive photo overlaps with the previous as the photo stitching
software works by identifying common features.</li>
<li>Also ideally take a GPS waypoint - you'll need that to add a
latitude and longitude for the panorama on the form on the main 
page. As an alternative, you can estimate the position by
clicking on the map on the main page.</li>
<li> To actually create a panorama, do the following:
use photo stitching
software, such as the free and open source
<a href='http://hugin.sourceforge.net'>Hugin</a> (commercial photostitchers are
available too) to stitch the photos to make a panorama.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Uploading</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submit a panorama on the form on the main page. 
You can use a GPS waypoint for the
lat and lon, or fill them in by clicking the map at the place you took the
photo.</li>
<li>Upload your panorama and wait for it to be authorised.</li>
<li>Align an authorised
panorama by rotating the camera icons. The camera should face
the same direction as the centre of the panorama.
Align it with the footpath or trail that you took
it from, by rotating the camera icon on the map so that it faces the same
direction as the centre of the panorama.</li>
</ul>
