This is the source for all web apps running on the Freemap server, primarily:
- Freemap itself;
- OpenTrailView;
- Freemap 3D (OSM WebGL demo).
To run on your server you will need to have a standard OSM PostGIS database
present, prepared by importing .osm files using osm2pgsql or Osmosis. You
also need to set up the Freemap/OTV specific tables, the SQL for this can be
found in database.sql.
You will also need to tweak the paths in common/defines.php.
