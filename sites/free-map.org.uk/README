This is the source for all web apps running on the Freemap server, primarily:
- Freemap itself;
- OpenTrailView;
- Freemap 3D (OSM WebGL demo).
To run on your server you will need to have a standard OSM PostGIS database
present, prepared by importing .osm files using osm2pgsql or Osmosis. You
also need to set up the Freemap/OTV specific tables, the SQL for this can be
found in database.sql.
You may also need to tweak some paths in some of the PHP scripts. Will try and
sort this out at some stage to render this unnecessary.
Code is licenced under the LGPL unless otherwise indicated.
